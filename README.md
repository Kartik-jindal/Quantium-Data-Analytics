# Quantium-Data-Analytics


This repository highlights my work with transaction datasets, focusing on data preparation, customer analytics, and commercial insights. By cleaning and organizing data, I uncovered purchasing patterns, identified benchmark stores, and validated trial store layouts through uplift testing. These findings led to actionable recommendations for optimizing product ranges, promotions, and store designs.


## üìå Key Analysis & Steps
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Loaded dataset using Pandas.
- Checked for missing values (none found).
- Converted DATE column to proper datetime format.
- Identified and removed outliers in sales.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for visualizing sales distributions.
- Analyzed customer behavior and transaction frequency.
- Computed total revenue and average transaction metrics.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization
- **Sales Distribution:** Histogram & KDE plots.
- **Outlier Detection:** Boxplots on `TOT_SALES`.
- **Customer Trends:** Transaction frequency plots.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
